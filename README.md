# Hi-Lo | Card Game

[View the live site here](https://mattgriffindev.github.io/hi-lo/ "Hi-Lo Game")

Hi-Lo is a browser game based on the card game, High Low. The aim of the game is to turn over six cards, correctly guessing whether the value of each card if higher or lower than the previous card. If the player guesses incorrectly, the game ends. The game is responsive and accessible on a range of web-enabled devices, making it easy to navigate for new and existing players.
